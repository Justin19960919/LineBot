Line, being one of the largest tele-communication companies in Asia, is popular
in both Taiwan and Japan. I like memes, and jokes, and I find it tiresome and 
tedious to find memes or quality jokes to read and tell, especially in occassions 
that we want to lighten up the mood, and people ask you to tell a joke. 

I created this Line chatbot, so I could grab jokes and memes from the internet,
and from instagram by just touching some buttons on the interface. Easy!

In order to use the line chatbot, you must download the [Line](https://line.me/zh-hant/)
app. To gain access to this line bot, please use this QR CODE:
